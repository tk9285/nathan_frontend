# SEI-OWLS-P4
Project 4 for SEI-OWLS



# Nathans Farm

Our assignment for Project 4 was to build a full stack web application. Our task was to use html, css, react, ruby, and rails to build this project. For this project I decided to build an ecommerce website called Nathans Farm to sell fresh organic produce products.

## Getting Started

The User will begin at the landing page where they will be greeted with the Nathans Farm banner. They'll have the option to click on the products link which will bring them to the products page. The User will have the option to either create a new product and add to their shopping cart or they can select an existing item. Once to User has completed adding items to their cart they can select the shopping cart and view their items. They can add additional items, change the quantity, and delete the products.
